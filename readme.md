- Backend

The backend service is deployed on Google App Engine. App Engine is a fully managed, PaaS for developing and hosting web applications at scale. With simple config file, the service can be deployed with scalability which is managed by Google Cloud. 

- Database

Elasticsearch is used as the database. Image/video files are stored in Google Cloud Storage but not in es. In contrast, a unique object url referring to that object is stored in es.
